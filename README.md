# xmltools

## xmlmerge
Merge multiple xmltv files.  Opens and writes uncompressed or gzipped xml.  Remote files are saved locally, and new versions will only be pulled after a specified number of hours.  Uses xmlmerge.yaml as input.

## timeshift
Pull channels and programs out of an existing xml file, change the air time for the programs, and write them to the output file.  Uses timeshift.yaml for input.

## change_pluto_ids
Changes the id names from pluto and roku xml files from i.mhj.nz.  If you only see channel ids that look like '2309340sdlfkj20' in your editor, then this will change them to something more easy to recognize, followed by .roku or .pluto suffix.  This was intended only for these specific files.

## change_gracenote_ids
Similar to the change_pluto_ids, but made to work with a file from the acidjesuz repo that only contains gracenote and schedulesdirect ids.  This was intended only for that specific file.

## make_dummies
Make dummy programs with the specified details.  Uses make_dummies.yaml for input.

## driver
An example driver script to chain these scripts together to run in order.  You need to configure each script first.
